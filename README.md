# **Whack-a-Food Game**

## **Overview**

This project is a Unity-based, whack-a-mole-like game where players must click on food items that randomly appear on a grid while avoiding skulls. The game tests and improves your User Interface (UI) skills by requiring you to debug various elements such as buttons, mouse clicks, score tracking, restart sequences, and difficulty settings.

## **Challenge Outcome**

- **Button Design:** All of the buttons have a clean design with properly aligned text.
- **Difficulty Setting:** Selecting a difficulty level changes the spawn rate of food items.
- **Score Tracking:** Clicking on a food item destroys it and updates the score in the top-left corner of the screen.
- **Restart Mechanic:** When the game is lost, a restart button appears, allowing players to play again.

## **Features**

- **Dynamic Difficulty Levels:** Choose from multiple difficulty settings that adjust the speed and frequency of food appearance.
- **Interactive UI Elements:** Includes well-designed buttons and on-screen text that provide feedback and keep players engaged.
- **Score Display:** Real-time score tracking that updates whenever a player successfully clicks a food item.
- **Restart Functionality:** Provides a seamless restart experience, allowing players to try again immediately after losing.
